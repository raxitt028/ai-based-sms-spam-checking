# AI Based SMS Spam Checking

**Author:** Raxit  
**Roll No:** 25MSCCS031

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **not spam**.  
A trained model and tokenizer are used to process text and predict whether an SMS is spam.

## Files in This Project
- `SMS (1).ipynb` — Notebook for data preprocessing, training, and testing.
- `sms_model.h5` — Trained model for spam detection.
- `tokenizer.json` — Tokenizer used for converting text into numerical form.
- `spam.csv` — Dataset used for training.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`SMS (1).ipynb`).
2. Run all cells to see data cleaning, model training, and predictions.
3. Use the saved model and tokenizer to classify new SMS messages.

## Purpose
To automatically detect spam SMS messages using a simple AI/ML model.
